A Kubernetes controller/operator that manages service provider integration tasks.

OAuth service is now part of this repository ([documentation](OAUTH.md)). 

## Building & Testing
This project provides a `Makefile` to run all the usual development tasks. If you simply run `make` without any arguments, you'll get a list of available "targets".

To build the project one needs to invoke (builds both `operator` and `oauth` binaries into `bin/` folder):

```
make build
```

To test the code (!tests requires running cluster in kubectl context):

```
make test
```

To build the docker images of the operator and oauth service one can run:

```
make docker-build
```

This will make a docker images called `quay.io/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator:next` and `quay.io/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-oauth:next` which might or might not be what you want.
To override the name of the image build, specify it in the `SPI_IMG_BASE` and/or `TAG_NAME` environment variable, e.g.:

```
SPI_IMG_BASE=quay.io/acme TAG_NAME=bugfix make docker-build
```

To push the images to an image repository one can use:

```
make docker-push
```

The image being pushed can again be modified using the environment variable:
```
SPI_IMG_BASE=quay.io/acme TAG_NAME=bugfix make docker-push
```

To set precise image names, one can use `SPIO_IMG` for operator image and `SPIS_IMG` for oauth image (see [Makefile](Makefile) for more details).

Before you push a PR to the repository, it is recommended to run an overall validity check of the codebase. This will
run the formatting check, static code analysis and all the tests:

```
make check
```

### KCP
We generate `APIResourceSchema`s and `APIExport` for KCP from our CRDs using `./hack/generate-kcp-api.sh` script or `make manifests-kcp`.
These have to be updated on every CRD change and committed. `APIResourceSchema` is immutable in KCP, so we version it by putting datetime as a name prefix.


## Configuration

It is expected by the Kustomize deployment that this configuration lives in a Secret in the same namespaces as SPI.
Name of the secret should be `shared-configuration-file` with this configuration yaml under `config.yaml` key.

This is basic configuration that is mandatory to run SPI Operator and OAuth services. [See config.go](pkg/spi-shared/config/config.go) for details (`persistedConfiguration`).

```yaml
serviceProviders:
- type: <service_provider_type>
  clientId: <service_provider_client_id>
  clientSecret: <service_provider_secret>
```

 - `<service_provider_type>` - type of the service provider. This must be one of the supported values: GitHub, Quay
 - `<service_provider_client_id>` - client ID of the OAuth application
 - `<service_provider_secret>` - client secret of the OAuth application that the SPI uses to access the service provider


_To create OAuth application at GitHub, follow [GitHub - Creating an OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)_

The rest of the configuration is applied using the environment variables or command line arguments.

In addition to the secret, there are 3 configmaps that contain the configuration for operator and oauth service.

| ConfigMap                                   | Applicable to              |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `spi-shared-environment-config`             | operator and oauth service |
| `spi-controller-manager-environment-config` | operator                   |
| `spi-oauth-service-environment-config`      | oauth service              |

The `spi-shared-environment-config` is bound to both the operator and oauth service and is therefore best used for
configuration options that should have the same value in both deployments.

#### Common configuration parameters
The `shared-environment-config` config map contains configuration options that will be applied to both the operator and
oauth service (if you look in the tables of the individual config options for operator and oauth service, you will see
that a lot of them are common). This especially makes sense for configuration that needs to have the same value in both
deployments, e.g. `BASEURL` and `VAULTHOST` are two examples of values that should be the same for both.

To change the VAULTHOST for both the oauth service and the operator, one can do:
```
kubectl -n spi-system patch configmap spi-shared-environment-config --type=merge -p '{"data": {"VAULTHOST": "https://vault.somewhere.else"}}'
kubectl -n spi-system rollout restart deployment/spi-controller-manager deployment/spi-oauth-service
```

This is the full set of parameters that are common for both the operator and the oauth service (note that while the
command line arguments and the environment variable names are the same, it may not make sense for both the operator
and oauth service to have the same value for them):

Note that this is not just a hostname, it is a full URL including a scheme, e.g. "https://acme.com/spi"                                           |

## Vault

Vault instance is deployed together with SPI components. `make deploy` or `make deploy_minikube` configures it automatically. 
For other deployments, like [infra-deployments](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments) run `./hack/vault-init.sh` manually.

There are couple of support scripts to work with Vault
 - `./hack/vault-init.sh` - Initialize and configure Vault instance
 - `./hack/vault-generate-template.sh` - generates deployment yamls from [vault-helm](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm). These should be commited in this repository.
 - injected in vault pod `/vault/userconfig/scripts/poststart.sh` - unseal vault storage. Runs automatically after pod startup.
 - injected in vault pod `/vault/userconfig/scripts/root.sh` - vault login as root with generated root token. Can be used for manual configuration.

## Running
It is possible to run the operator both in and out of a Kubernetes cluster.

### Out of cluster
There is a dedicated make target to run the operator locally:

```
make run
```

This will also deploy RBAC setup and the CRDs into the cluster and will run the operator locally with the permissions of the deployed service account as configure in the Kustomize files in the `config` directory.

To run the operator with the permissions of the currently active kubectl context, use:

```
make run_as_current_user
```

### In cluster
Again, there is a dedicated make target to deploy the operator into the cluster:

For OpenShift, use:

```
make deploy
```

For Kubernetes, use:
```
make deploy_k8s
```

Once deployed, several manual modifications need to be made. See the below section about manual testing
with custom images for details.

## Debugging

It is possible to debug the operator using `dlv` or some IDE like `vscode`. Just point the debugger of your choice to `main.go` as the main program file and remember to configure the environment variables for the correct/intended function of the operator.

The `launch.json` file for `vscode` is included in the repository so you should be all set if using that IDE. Just make sure to run `make prepare` before debugging.

## Manual testing with custom images

This assumes the current working directory is your local checkout of this repository.

First, we need to enable the ingress addon (skip this step, obviously, if you're working with OpenShift):
```
minikube addons enable ingress
```

Then we can install our CRDs:

```
make install
```

Next, we're ready to build and push the custom operator and oauth images:
```
make docker-build docker-push SPI_IMG_BASE=<MY-CUSTOM-IMAGE-BASE> TAG_NAME=<MY-CUSTOM-TAG-NAME>
```

Next step is to deploy the operator and oauth service along with all other Kubernetes objects to the cluster.
This step assumes that you also want to use a custom image for both SPI OAuth service and Operator. If you want to use the
default one, specify just the `SPIS_IMG` or `SPIO_IMG` env var below.

On OpenShift use:
```
make deploy SPI_IMG_BASE=<MY-CUSTOM-IMAGE-BASE> TAG_NAME=<MY-CUSTOM-TAG-NAME>
```

On Minikube use:
```
make deploy_minikube SPI_IMG_BASE=<MY-CUSTOM-IMAGE-BASE> TAG_NAME=<MY-CUSTOM-TAG-NAME>
```

Next, comes the manual part. We need to set the external domain of the ingress/route of the OAuth service and reconfigure
the OAuth service and operator to know about it:

On Minikube, we can use `nip.io` to set the hostname like this:
```
SPI_HOST="spi.$(minikube ip).nip.io"
kubectl -n spi-system patch ingress spi-oauth-ingress --type=json --patch '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/rules/0/host", "value": "'$SPI_HOST'"}]'
```

On Kubernetes, the host of the ingress needs to be set be the means appropriate to your cluster environment.

On OpenShift, you merely need to note down the hostname of your route.

In either case, store the hostname of your ingress/route in the `$SPI_HOST` environment variable

Also, note down the client id and client secret of the OAuth application in Github that you want SPI to act as
and store the in the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` env vars respectively.

Next, we need to reconfigure the oauth service and operator. Both are configured using a single configmap:

```
SPI_CONFIGMAP=$(kubectl -n spi-system get configmap -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=service-provider-integration-operator | grep spi-oauth-config | cut -f1 -d' ')
kubectl -n spi-system patch configmap $SPI_CONFIGMAP --type=json --patch '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/data/config.yaml", "value": "'"$(kubectl -n spi-system get configmap $SPI_CONFIGMAP -o jsonpath='{.data.config\.yaml}' | yq -y 'setpath(["baseUrl"]; "https://'$SPI_HOST'")' | yq -y 'setpath(["serviceProviders", 0, "clientId"]; "'$CLIENT_ID'")' | yq -y 'setpath(["serviceProviders", 0, "clientSecret"]; "'$CLIENT_SECRET'")' | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g')"'"}]'
```

All that is left for the setup is to restart the oauth service and operator to load the new configuration:
```
kubectl -n spi-system scale deployment spi-controller-manager spi-oauth-service --replicas=0
kubectl -n spi-system scale deployment spi-controller-manager spi-oauth-service --replicas=1
```

### Go through the OAuth flow manually

Let's assume that a) we're using the default namespace and that b) the default service account has permissions
to CRUD `SPIAccessToken`s and `SPIAccessTokenBinding`s in the default namespace.

This can be ensured by running:

```
kubectl apply -f hack/give-default-sa-perms-for-accesstokens.yaml
```

Let's create the `SPIAccessTokenBinding`:
```
kubectl apply -f samples/spiaccesstokenbinding.yaml --as system:serviceaccount:default:default
```

Now, we need initiate the OAuth flow. We've already created the spi access token binding. Let's examine
it to see what access token it bound to:

```
SPI_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(kubectl get spiaccesstokenbindings test-access-token-binding -o=jsonpath='{.status.linkedAccessTokenName}')
```

Let's see if it has OAuth URL to go through:

```
OAUTH_URL=$(kubectl get spiaccesstoken $SPI_ACCESS_TOKEN -o=jsonpath='{.status.oAuthUrl}') 
```

Now let's use the bearer token of the default service account to authenticate with the OAuth service endpoint:

```
curl -v -k $OAUTH_URL 2>&1 | grep 'location: ' | cut -d' ' -f3
```

This gave us the link to the actual service provider (github) that we can use in the browser to approve and finish 
the OAuth flow.

Upon returning from that OAuth flow, you should end up back on the SPI endpoint on the `.../github/callback` URL.
This concludes the flow and you should be able to see the secret configured in the binding with the requested data:

```
kubectl get secret token-secret -o yaml
```


## Supported providers and token kinds

The currently supported list of providers and token kinds is following:

### Github

 - OAuth token via user authentication flow
 - Personal access token via manual upload

### Quay

  - OAuth token via user authentication flow
  - Robot account credentials via manual upload

### Snyk & other providers that do not support OAuth

 - Manual credentials upload only with both username and token required.
   Single token per namespace per host is stored.
   See details below.


## Storing username and password credentials for any provider by it's URL

  It is now possible to store username + token/password credentials for nearly any
  provider that may offer them (like Snyk.io etc). It is can be done in a few steps:
  
 - Create simple SPIAccessTokenBinging, indicating provider-s URL only:
```
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: SPIAccessTokenBinding
metadata:
 name: test-access-token-binding
 namespace: default
spec:
 repoUrl: https://snyk.io/
 secret:
   type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```
and push it into namespace:
```
kubectl apply -f samples/spiaccesstokenbinding.yaml --as system:serviceaccount:default:default
```

 - Determine the SPIAccessTokenName:
 ```
SPI_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(kubectl get spiaccesstokenbindings test-access-token-binding -o=jsonpath='{.status.linkedAccessTokenName}')
```


 - Perform manual push of the credential data: 
```
curl -k -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $(hack/get-default-sa-token.sh)" -d'{"username": "userfoo", "access_token": "4R28N79MT"}' "https://<cluster-host-or-ip>/token/default/$SPI_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Note that both `username` and `access_token` fields are mandatory. 
`204` response indicates that credentials successfully uploaded and stored.
Please note that SPI service didn't perform any specific validity checks 
for the user provided credentials, so it's assumed user provides a correct data.  


## Retrieving file content from SCM repository
There is dedicated controller for file content requests, which can be performed by putting
a `SPIFileContentRequest` CR in the namespace, as follows: 

```
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: SPIFileContentRequest
metadata:
  name: test-file-content-request
  namespace: default
spec:
  repoUrl: https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator
  filePath: hack/boilerplate.go.txt

```
Controller then generates SPIAccessTokenBinding and waiting for it to be ready/injected.
Once binding became ready, controller fetches requested content using credentials from injected secret. A successful attempt will result in base64 encoded file content
appearing in the `status.content` field on the `SPIFileContentRequest` CR.
```
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: SPIFileContentRequest
metadata:
  name: test-file-content-request
  namespace: default
spec:
  filePath: hack/boilerplate.go.txt
  repoUrl: https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator
status:
  content: LyoKQ29weXJpZ2h0IDIw....==
  contentEncoding: base64
  linkedBindingName: ""
  phase: Delivered
```


At this stage, file request CR-s are intended to be single-used, so no further content refresh 
or accessibility checks must be expected. A new CR instance should be used to re-request the content.
  
Currently, the file retrievals are limited to GitHub repositories only, and files size up to 2 Megabytes.
