        description: SPIAccessTokenDataUpdate is a special CRD that advertises to
          the controller in the Kubernetes cluster that there has been an update of
          the data in the secret storage. Because secret storage is out-of-cluster,
          updates to it are not registered by the controllers. This CRD serves as
          a "trigger" for reconciliation of the SPIAccessToken or RemoteSecret after
          the data has been updated in the secret storage. The caller that updates
          the data in the secret storage is responsible for creating an object pointing
          to the SPIAccessToken or RemoteSecret that should have been affected.
