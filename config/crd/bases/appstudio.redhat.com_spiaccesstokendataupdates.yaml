        description: SPIAccessTokenDataUpdate is a special CRD that advertises to
          the controller in the Kubernetes cluster that there has been an update of
          the data in the token storage. Because token storage is out-of-cluster,
          updates to it are not registered by the controllers. This CRD serves as
          a "trigger" for reconciliation of the SPIAccessToken after the data has
          been updated in the token storage. The caller that updates the data in the
          token storage is responsible for creating an object pointing to the SPIAccessToken
          that should have been affected.
